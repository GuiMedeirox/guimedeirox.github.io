# About me

Hello! I'm Guilherme, a brazillian developer seeking to improve as a person and wannabe software engineer. This blog is my space to practice **"Learn in Public"** - a philosophy that believes we learn better when we share our knowledge.

## About the Blog

This blog was born from the desire to document my learning journey and share knowledge with the community. I believe that:

- **Knowledge should be shared** - When we teach, we learn better
- **Transparency is powerful** - Show the process, not just the results
- **Community is essential** - We learn a lot from feedback and discussions
- **Consistency is fundamental** - Small daily steps lead to great results

## Learn in Public Philosophy

The "Learn in Public" concept was popularized by [Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) and is based on some principles:

1. **Document your learning** - Write about what you're learning
2. **Share the process** - Show not just the results, but the path
3. **Be transparent** - Admit errors and difficulties
4. **Help others** - Answer questions and participate in discussions
5. **Build in public** - Develop visible projects
